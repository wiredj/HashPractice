HashPractice by Jason White

This is an open source, interactive hash table program that displays internal information about the processes of inserting, searching, and resizing.  It allows you to input a table size and a hashing value, or use the built-in default of size 101 and hashing value 100.  It displays when collisions are encountered, and where key-value pairs are hashed to. This program is intended to help the user understand how a hash table works, and how it can be coded.

Compile and run the program by ensuring all related files are in the same folder and opening them with a C++ compiler, such as CLion.  The input.txt file can be moved to a convenient folder for use with the File Input feature of the program.
